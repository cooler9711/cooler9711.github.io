    so, how are you? most of the time, i go by cooler9711. i do some coding stuff and really want to learn swift, but AP classes take up so much time.
  </p>
  <p>
    the/a career that i really want is security researcher. i already have a little mini write-up of taking over a domain <a href="https://github.com/cooler9711/vulnerable-to-takeover" class="hvr-grow-shadow">here</a>. that was actually pretty fun to figure out. 
  </p>
  <p>
    ok look so i'm not really one for internet drama, but i really think that net neturality should be a thing. i mean, we deserve to do what we want on it. so yeah. <a class="hvr-grow-shadow button" href="https://www.battleforthenet.com/?subject=net-neutrality-dies-in-one-month-unless-we-stop-it">here's a good website on stuff</a>
