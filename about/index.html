    so, how are you? most of the time, i go by cooler9711. i do some coding stuff and really want to learn swift, java, and maybe rust, but AP classes take up so much time.
  </p>
  <p>
    the/a career that i really want is security researcher. i already have a little mini write-up of taking over a domain <a href="https://github.com/cooler9711/vulnerable-to-takeover" class="hvr-grow-shadow">here</a>. that was actually pretty fun to figure out.
  </p>
  <p>
    google code-in was fun. i only got 4 tasks done though. i could've gotten more, but around this time was <i>super</i> busy for me. i had finals, i had a robotics comp on 1/13/18, family stuff, etc. etc. i'm just happy that i earned the t-shirt. it better be good, or else...
